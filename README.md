## Signal-Equalizer üéöÔ∏èüéöÔ∏è

This project develops a desktop application that functions as a signal equalizer. A signal equalizer is a tool used to adjust the balance of frequency components within a signal, allowing users to emphasize or attenuate specific frequency ranges. In this application, users can visually manipulate the magnitude of the frequency components of a signal using an intuitive interface, and reconstruct the modified signal for further analysis or playback. The equalizer provides both a graphical representation of the frequency spectrum and real-time feedback on the changes made.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è
### Equalizer Modes 

* **Uniform Range Mode:** Splits the signal's frequency range into 10 equal sections, each adjustable via a slider.

* **Animal Sounds Mode:** Adjusts the magnitude of individual animal sounds within a mixed signal of four distinct animal sounds.

* **Musical Instruments Mode:**  Adjusts the magnitude of specific musical instruments within a mixed signal containing four instruments.

* **ECG Signal Abnormalities:** Where each slider can control the magnitude of a specific abnormality (e.g. ECG arrhythmia) in the input biological signal.

* **Mixed Music and Animals Mode:**  Allows users to adjust the presence of different animal sounds and musical instruments within a mixed audio signal.

* **Mixed Vocals and Music Mode:** Allows users to adjust the levels of different vocals and musical elements within a song.

* **Weiner Filter Mode:** Reduces noise from a sound signal by applying adaptive filtering techniques.

### Other Features:

*   Sliders for adjusting frequency magnitudes of signal components.
*   Two linked cine signal viewers to display the input and output signals synchronously, with functionality for playback control, zoom, pan, and reset. 
*   Two spectrograms (one for input and one for output) that visually represent the frequency content of the signals. Spectrograms can be toggled on/off.
*   The ability to display the frequency range in either linear scale or Audiogram scale.
